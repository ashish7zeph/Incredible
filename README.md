# Scary <hello world!>

This is actually an amazing python script, the author of which is exactly me. Well! the fun part about the script is, its a hello world program. Oh!! only that... you might be thinking... But no, not only that, the interesting part here is-- Its a python script to print "hello world!", but without the use of-- any print statement or even without the use of any output statement. Yes, you got it correct!

Well you might copy the script to your or online python 3 compiler and can run to check if it works. 
And also you could try to decypher it...
