# Scary <hello world!>

This is actually an amazing python script, the author of which is exactly me.
Well! the fun part about the script is, its a hello world program.
oh!! only that... you might be thinking... 
But no, not only that, the interesting part here is--
Its a python script to print "hello world!", but without the use of--
any print statement or even without the use of any output statment.
Yes, you got it correct!

Well you might copy the script to your or online python 3 compiler
and can run to check if it works
And also you could try to decypher it...
